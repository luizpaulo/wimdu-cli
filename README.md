Z# Wimdu coding challenge

## Solution

  Just use bin/wimdu.

  Commands are:

  * **bin/wimdu list** - (List all the completed properties)
  * **bin/wimdu new** - (Create a new property)
  * **bin/wimdu continue <id>** - (Continues to fill a property fields)
  * **bin/wimdu uncompleted** - (List all uncompleted properties)
  * **bin/wimdu show <id>** - (Shows complete info of a property)

I am currently working on feature specs, but was told to me that the time available for this challenge is for hours,
so i am pushing the code right now to git.
